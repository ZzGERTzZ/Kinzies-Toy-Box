# vehicle_table_crunch

The vehicle table crunch tool for Saints Row is designed to allow creation of cvtf files from the vehicle xml table files. It assumes files live in data\tables\ relative to the working directory. cvtf files are written to data\tables\vehicles.

Running the tool involves the command line so batch files can easily be created to accomplish tasks. There is only one command line argument, which is the name of the vehicle to crunch such as 'bike_dirt01'.
